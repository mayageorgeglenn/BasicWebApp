# [Calculator App]
[Hello, 

This is Maya's Calculator App. 

It provides the user with basic functions of a calculator: addition, subtraction, mulitplicaiton, division, and even exponenets. The user has the ability to input two numbers and then select the operation they would like to do to those two numbers. Once they click the button, they will be taken to the results page and should click the click me button. Then their answer will appear. If they want to do another operation they can click to go back to the home page. Then, there are two special buttons: the smiley button and the hearts button. The smiley button takes the user to its own page and prints a number of smiley and frowny faces based on the numbers the user inputted. The hearts butotn takes the user to its own page and prints a number of full and broken hearts based off of the numbers the user inputted. ]
